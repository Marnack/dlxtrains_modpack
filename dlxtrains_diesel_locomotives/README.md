# DlxTrains Diesel Locomotives

This mod adds AdvTrains compatible diesel locomotives to Minetest.  In this initial release, it contains a modern European industrial diesel locomotive.

Note: DLX is used here to denote items, tools, wagons and locomotives defined in the DlxTrains ModPack.

## Craft Items

The following craft items are defined and added to the game if the "Complexity of DLX wagon crafting recipes" setting defined in **DlxTrains** is set to "Standard".  They are not added to the game if it is set to "Basic".  The default value for the setting is "Standard".

- **Diesel Locomotive Battery Pack** - This item represents the batteries that provide power to the locomotive's electrical systems.  They are recharged when the diesel engine is running.  Note that battery power for DLX diesel locomotives is not currently represented or tracked in game.
- **Diesel Locomotive Bogie** - Similar to the bogies used on wagons, this is a pair of wheel sets that are connected by a framework that can turn independently of the locomotive that it supports.  Unlike wagon bogies, however, it also contains gearboxes or electric motors (depending on the type of diesel locomotive) that are used to propel the train.
- **Diesel Locomotive Chassis** - This is the underframe of the locomotive.
- **Diesel Locomotive Cooling Fan** - This is an electric motor and a set of metal fan blades that are used to force air through a set of radiators to cool the engine while it is running.
- **Diesel Locomotive Cooling Unit** - Constructed from a cooling fan and  radiators, this component is used to keep the locomotive's engine temperature in a safe, operational range.  Small  shunting locomotives may only have one of these while larger main line diesel locomotives may have many.
- **Diesel Locomotive Engine** - This is an internal combustion engine and is the primer power source for diesel locomotives.  There are several different types of diesel locomotives which are typically classified based on how they use their diesel engine.  Some locomotives use their engine's power directly to move the locomotive such as with diesel-hydraulic and diesel-mechanical locomotives.  Others, such as the diesel-electric locomotive, use the engine to power a generator that provides electricity to electric motors that are built into their bogies.
- **Diesel Locomotive Fuel Tank** - This item represents the locomotive's fuel tank.  Note that fuel is not currently represented or tracked in game which means that DLX locomotives can run indefinitely.
- **Diesel Locomotive Hood** - Typically made from sheet metal and various structural elements, hoods are the outer covering of the locomotive's engine, its transmission and other vital components.  Depending on the design of the locomotive it will typically have one or two of these.
- **Diesel Locomotive Hydraulic Transmission** - This component is used to transfer power from the engine to the drive shaft and bogies and to control speed and direction.
- **Diesel Locomotive Radiator** - Radiators are a critical element of a diesel engine since they are needed to keep it from over-heating and becoming permanently damaged. They typically consist of long coiled tubes to which many metal fins are attached.  Fluid is circulated through the engine, into the radiators and back.  The fluid thus transfers the heat from the engine to the metal fins where the heat is radiated into the air and away from the engine.
- **European G1206 Diesel Locomotive Body** - This is the set of components that are added to a chassis to make a European G1206 Diesel Locomotive.

## Locomotives

The following table summarizes the current set of DlxTrains Diesel Locomotives.

Icon|Wagon Name|Length (m)|Coupler Type|Max Speed (m/s)|Livery Options
:---:|---|:---:|---|:---:|:---:
![](textures/dlxtrains_diesel_locomotives_locomotive_type1_inv.png)|European G1206 Diesel Locomotive|7.35|Buffer & Chain|25|4

Note that locomotives may not be available in-game if the "Longest DLX wagon to include in game" setting defined in **DlxTrains** is set to a value other than "Unlimited".  That setting will use the lengths shown in the table when determining the locomotives to be excluded.

### European G1206 Diesel Locomotive

The European G1206 Diesel Locomotive in DlxTrains is loosely based on the MaK/Vossloh G1206 diesel-hydraulic locomotive that was built in Kiel, Germany beginning in 1997.  It was designed for both heavy shunting and main line freight duties and was used by both state and private railway operators.

In game, the locomotive features several effects when the locomotive is moving:
* The head and tail lights will appear to turn on (but not illuminate) based on the locomotive's direction of movement.
* Its two radiator cooling fans will appear to be spinning while the locomotive is moving.
* The diesel engine's sound will change based on the locomotive's velocity (unless this feature is disabled in the **DlxTrains** mod settings).
* The amount of diesel smoke produced by the locomotive will vary based on its acceleration, velocity and the length of the train (unless this feature is disabled in the **DlxTrains** mod settings).

The MaK/Vossloh G1206 locomotive is driven with either end being used as "forward".  Since there seems to be some preference by real world engineers to drive with the "short hood" end as forward due to better visibility, player avatars are positioned to face in that direction when in the cabin of the European G1206 Diesel Locomotive.

Due to current limitations in Minetest, the player's view while on board the locomotive will be from a point in space just above the center of the locomotive rather than from inside the cabin.  While this viewpoint is certainly sufficient, switching to third person view while driving the locomotive provides a slightly different perspective from outside the locomotive that might also be useful.
