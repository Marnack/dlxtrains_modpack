#	Complexity of crafting recipes for DLX wagons and locomotives.
#
#	Standard: DLX wagons and locomotives are crafted from several intermediate craft items that represent their major components.
#	Basic: DLX wagons and locomotives are crafted using simplified recipes.  This results in fewer craft items being included in the game.
